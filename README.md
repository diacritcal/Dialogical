Interaction and Negotiation in Learning and Understanding Dialog

Interaction and negotiation are an essential component of natural language understanding in conversation. We argue this is particularly the case in building artificial agents that rely primarily on language to interact with humans. Rather than thinking about misunderstanding—thinking the user said one thing when he said another—and non-understanding—not having a clue what the user was talking about—as a problem to be overcome, it makes more sense to think of such events as opportunities to learn something and a natural part of understanding that becomes essential when the agent trying to understand has a limited language understanding capability. Moreover, many of the same strategies that are effective in situations in which the agent’s limited language facility fails also apply to the agent actively engaging the user in an unobtrusive manner to collect data and ground truth in order to extend its repertoire of services that it can render and to improve its existing language understanding capabilities. In the case of developing an agent to engage users in conversations about music, actively soliciting information from users about their music interests and resolving misunderstandings on both sides about what services the application can offer and what service in particular the user wants now is already a natural part of the conversation. Data collected from thousands or millions of users would provide an invaluable resource for training NLP components that could be used to build more sophisticated conversational agents.
